# Template repository for dissertation

On each push to main or develop branches,
GitHub Actions automatically typeset the manuscript and upload the output PDF as a
[Release](https://github.com/simaki/dissertation-template/releases).
Releases are associated with tags so that one can retrieve the manuscript at previous moments.
